      This website was created by Belen Saavedra Rios and Gerard Nagel as part
      of their senior seminar. The goal was to help computer science students
      across the globe find the best PhD program suited for them. This website
      includes a map of the world with each program represented with pins on the
      map. The pins include information about the program including the
      programâ€™s stipend to cater to those who need financial help. In the bottom
      left corner of the website, there is a chatbox. Inside the box, you can
      talk to a chat bot that has been trained to ask you questions and us your
      answers to recommend programs it thinks would be good for you.
